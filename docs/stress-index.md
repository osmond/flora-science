# Stress Index

The stress index combines several plant health factors into a single 0-100 score.
Lower values indicate a healthier plant.

## Formula
- **Overdue watering** – up to 30 points (each overdue day adds 10).
- **Low hydration** – up to 40 points (0% moisture = 40 points).
- **Temperature deviation** – up to 15 points (1.5 points per °C from 25°C).
- **Light imbalance** – up to 15 points (0.3 points per unit from ideal 50).

## Mitigation Tips
- Maintain a regular watering schedule.
- Monitor soil moisture and adjust watering to keep hydration between 40-80%.
- Keep plants near stable, appropriate temperatures.
- Adjust lighting or move plants to achieve balanced light exposure.
